CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:26 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsqlite3.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "sqlite3", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "sqlite3" with any
  of the following names:

    sqlite3Config.cmake
    sqlite3-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "sqlite3" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "sqlite3_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "sqlite3" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
